# Command Line Social Network

### About
This project involves creating a command line social network that allows users to connect with people from all around the world. The social network is built using Python and utilizes SQL queries to manage user data, such as profiles, friends, and messages.

The social network allows users to create a profile, search for other users, add friends, and send messages. The SQL queries are used to retrieve user data, such as profile information and messages, as well as to manage the relationships between users, such as friend requests and friend lists.

This project provides an opportunity to develop both Python programming and SQL query skills, as well as to explore the concept of social networking. By working with a command line interface, it also provides a unique and challenging development experience. The project demonstrates some interesting SQL queries, such as joins, subqueries, and aggregations, that are commonly used in real-world database applications.
